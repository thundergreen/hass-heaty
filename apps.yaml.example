      # (optional)
      schedule:

      # A schedule consists of a number of rules, each defining:
      # - a set of weekdays and
      # - a set of daytimes and corresponding temperature expressions.
      #
      # For each rule, timers are created that set the desired temperatures
      # at the specified times on all weekdays the rule is valid on.
      #
      # This means, you don't specify time ranges and assign
      # temperatures to them. You rather provide times at which
      # a temperature change should happen.
      #
      # The different parts of a rule have to be separated by semicolons.
      # Any whitespace contained in a rule is ignored.
      #
      # What is a temperature expression?
      # Well, that is a fairly powerful way of expressing a temperature
      # based on the state of entities, constants and a mathematical
      # expression that glues all the values together.
      # Actually, a temperature expression is evaluated as normal Python code.
      # There is an object available under the name "app" which represents
      # the appdaemon.AppDaemon object of Heaty. You could, for instance,
      # retrieve values of input sliders via the normal appdaemon API.
      # The following modules are also available inside time expressions:
      # - datetime
      #
      # Let's look at some examples to make things clearer.

      # From Monday to Friday, set temperature to 20.5 °C at 7.45 AM,
      # and to 16 °C at 11.00 PM.
      - 1-5;  07:45 = 20.5;  23:00 = 16

      # On weekends, set temperature to 20.5 °C at 8.15 AM,
      # and to 16 °C at 11.30 PM.
      - 6-7;  8:15 = 20.5;  23:30 = 16

      # On Mondays and Thursdays, additionally set temperature to the
      # value of input_slider.temp at 6.00 PM.
      - 1,4; 18:00 = app.get_state("input_slider.temp")

      # Let's have it a bit warmer at Christmas Eve.
      # Here is another interesting thing you can do with time expressions.
      # If such an expression evaluates to None, it is treated as if it
      # doesn't exist at all. You can use this behaviour to create rules
      # that are only valid for a specific time range, for instance.
      - 1-7; 18:00 = 22 if datetime.date.today() == datetime.date(2017, 12, 24) else None
      - 1-7; 23:59 = 20 if datetime.date.today() == datetime.date(2017, 12, 24) else None
